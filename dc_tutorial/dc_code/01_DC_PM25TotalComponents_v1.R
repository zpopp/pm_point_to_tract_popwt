##Purpose:      Merging Mean PM2.5 from Joel Schwartz
##              Annual Mean PM2.5 Components (EC, NH4, NO3, OC, SO4) 50m Urban 
##              and 1km Non-Urban Area Grids for Contiguous U.S., v1 (2000â€“2019)
##              https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/aqdh-pm2-5-component-ec-nh4-no3-oc-so4-50m-1km-contiguous-us-2000-2019/data-download
##Note:         For one year, this processing uses ~45-50GB of memory. This only
##              needs to be run once as it aggregates PM2.5 that will be used for 
##              all states and regardless of census block year.
##Overall Processing Steps:
## 1) Process raw annual PM2.5 components files from SEDAC into total_pm25 nationwide file, and add uid to allow 
##    for future joins of PM2.5 measures, running as bash by year (TotalComponentsPM25.R; this file)
##    One of the years which were processed in step 1 will need to be saved as a 
##    .gpkg to allow for easier spatial processing (PM25_convert_ogr19.sh)
## 2) Spatially join total components PM2.5 for one year (eg: 2019) to 2010 DC census blocks.
## 3) Aggregate data from block to block group/tract/county based on population or area (PopWt*.R)

##Notes on Tutorial:
##    The PM2.5 data used in this tutorial is shared through SEDAC, which is 
##    housed within NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS)
##    Users will need to create an account to download data. For more information
##    on how to download these data directly through R, please see the CHORDS
##    toolkit: https://niehs.github.io/PCOR_bookdown_tools/chapter-nasa-earthdata.html 
##
##    For this section of the GitHub repository on population-weighted PM2.5
##    data, a subset of the data for Washington, D.C. has been cut and shared.
##    This was done to allow users to walk through the steps of processing
##    without needing to use a cloud computing environment. Cloud computing is 
##    needed to conduct nationwide processing because of the size of the files
##    and the burden of spatial aggregation with these large data.
