##Version Hist:   Updated in Jan 2024 to run for 2010 blocks
##Purpose:        Joining PM2.5 estimates from Joel Schwartz group to census block geographies.
##                Joining PM2.5 to 2010 block geographies. If processing multiple years,
##                additional data can be separately joined to the 2010 points by UID after
##                the intersection of blocks/points in this script is conducted. This will
##                reduce processing time as spatial joins are more computationally intensive
##                then a join by attribute (eg: uid)
##                PM2.5 assessed at 50m by 50m grid in urban and 1km by 1km grid in nonurban settings. 
##                 Annual Mean PM2.5 Components (EC, NH4, NO3, OC, SO4) 50m Urban 
##                 and 1km Non-Urban Area Grids for Contiguous U.S., v1 (2000â€“2019)

##Overall Processing Steps:
## 1) Process raw annual PM2.5 components files from SEDAC into total_pm25 nationwide file, and add uid to allow 
##    for future joins of PM2.5 measures, running as bash by year (PM25TotalComponents.R)
## 2) Spatially join total components PM2.5 for one year (eg: 2019) to 2010 US census blocks,
##    running as bash by state due to large processing time (PM25_Process_Blocks.R; this file)
## 3) Aggregate data from block to block group/tract/county based on population or area (PopWt*.R)
## 4) Combine state-level tract shapefiles into nationwide tract dataset. (Nationwide_Join.R)

#
# These inputs are only relevant if aiming to process multiple states of PM2.5 data.
# If aiming to process a single state or county, the command arguments can be removed
